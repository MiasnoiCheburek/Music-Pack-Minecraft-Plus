title: Holder Triggers Overview
hide_meta: true

A holder trigger is a type of trigger that can have sub-triggers. These sub-triggers are denoted by the use of the
`identifier` parameter. What this means is that these types of triggers cover a wide variety of use cases
and as such are (within the same channel) allowed to have multiple parameter sets. Using 2 different identifiers on the
same holder trigger is like using 2 different simple triggers that have virtually the same effect. On the other hand,
using the same identifier for the same holder trigger is like reusing the same simple trigger. Identifier are unique
for both triggers and channels. This means that something like `dimension-battle` will always be different from
something like `mob-battle`. It also means that adding `dimension-battle` on 2 different channels will still define 2
separate triggers.

Outside of the implied trigger system, identifiers do not have an effect on whether a trigger can activate. As such,
identifier parameters can be set to any string value. For example, a `time` trigger with an identifier of `night`
(`time-night`) will not necessarily be active during the night. In this case, the `time_bundle` or `start_hour` &
`end_hour`parameters are what determines that.

The **25** trigger holders are `advancement`, `biome`, `blockentity`, `command`, `difficulty`, `dimension`, `effect`,
 `gamestage`, `gui`, `height`, `inventory`, `light`, `mob`, `moon`, `pvp`, `raid`, `rainintensity`, `riding`, `season`,
 `statistic`, `structure`, `time`, `tornado`, `victory`, and `zones`
