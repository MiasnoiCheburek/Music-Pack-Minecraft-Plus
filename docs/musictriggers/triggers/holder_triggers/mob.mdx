```
active_cooldown <default: 0>
    Determines the number of ticks that the trigger will not be able to
    activate for after being active and deactivating.

champion <default: [ any ]>
    Requires Champions.
    Entities must have at least one of the champion values listed here.
    Including an `any` entry ignores the champion check entirely and
    including an `all` entry accepts all champion names.

detection_range <default: 16>
    Determines the range in blocks around the player that this trigger will
    check for a matching entity in.

detection_y_ratio <default: 0.5>
    Determines the percentage ratio of the vertical range for the
    detection_range parameter. For example, the default values of 0.5 and 16
    for detection_range means that up to 16 blocks from the player will be
    checked in both x and z directions while up to 8 blocks will be checked
    both y directions.

display_matcher <default: exact>
    Determines the matching strategy for the display_name parameter. Accepts
    exact, partial, or regex.
    exact = The display_name must match exactly.
    partial = The display_name is allowed to partially match.
    regex = The display_name is treated as a regex expression.

display_name <default: [ any ]>
    The display name of the entity must match one of the entries here
    according to the strategy specified by the display_matcher parameter.

fade_in <default: 0>
    The number of ticks it will take the trigger to fade in after the trigger
    activates.

fade_out <default: 0>
    The number of ticks it will take the trigger to fade out when the trigger
    is no longer active.

health <default: 100>
    Determines the (inclusive) maxiumum health percentage an entity can have
    in order for the trigger to activate.

horde_health_percentage <default 50>
    Determines the (inclusive) minimum percentage of entities in relation to
    the min_entities parameter that must fulfill the health parameter for the
    trigger to activate.

horde_targeting_percentage <default 50>
    Determines the (inclusive) minimum percentage of entities in relation to
    the min_entities parameter that must fulfill the mob_targeting parameter
    for the trigger to activate.

infernal <default: [ any ]>
    Requires AtomicStryker's Infernal Mobs.
    Entities must have at least one of the infernal values listed here.
    Including an `any` entry ignores the infernal check entirely and
    including an `all` entry accepts all infernal names.

max_entities <default: 2147483647>
    Determines the (inclusive) maxium number of entities that are allowed to
    meet the specified parameters in order for the trigger to be active.

max_tracks <default: 0>
    Determines the maximum number of audio tracks that will be able to play
    while the trigger is active. The counter is reset once the trigger is no
    longer active. Any value less than 1 will be treated as infinite.

min_entities <default: 1>
    Determines the (inclusive) minimum number of entities that must meet the
    specified parameters in order for the trigger to be active.

mob_nbt <default: [ any ]>
    This parameter is very complex. Only use it if you already have a good
    understanding of how NBT data works.\n\nThis parameter works by specifying
    a prefix followed by a key or potentially multiple keys sometimes followed
    by a value. Each prefix,key, and value must be separated by a semicolon
    which could look something like `prefix;key;key;value`. The parameter
    passes when any of the entries pass.
    Prefixes must be fully capitalized and are only allowed at the beginning
    of the entry or directly after another prefix that can be modified.
    There are 6 different prefixes that can be used when checking for specific
    NBT data.
    EQUAL = The tag value must be equal to the specified value. Modifies
        LESSER to change the operation to <= and GREATER to change the
        operation to >=
    GREATER = The tag value must be greater than the specified value.
    INVERT = Modifies any non INVERT prefix to change its operation similar to
        the not parameter. If used alone it will check if the tag value is
        evaluates to false.
    KEY_PRESENT = Checks if the specified tag exists as a compound tag.
    LESSER = The tag value must be less than the specified value.
    VAL_PRESENT = Checks if the specified tag exists as a tag with a non-tag
        value.

mob_targeting <default: true>
    Determines whether an entity needs to be targeting the player for the
    trigger to be active. Note that entities cannot target players in creative
    or spectator mode.

not <default: false>
    Enabling this inverts the activation requirements meaning that the trigger
    will NOT be active when its parameters are met. Ignored by most time-based
    parameters.

passive_persistence <default: true>
    Determines whether the persistence parameter should be applied when the
    trigger is not active. When disabled, the trigger will ignore its
    persistence parameter if there is a higher priority trigger active.

persistence <default: 0>
    Determines the number of ticks after its parameters are no longer met that
    the trigger will be playable for.

play_when_paused <default: false>
    Determines whether the trigger is playable while the game is paused.
    Requires has_paused_music to be active for the channel.

priority <default: 3800>
    The priority value of the trigger in regards to other triggers that are
    playable at the same time. By default the highest priority trigger always
    wins and will be active, but that can be changed via the debug config. See
    the independent_audio_pools and reverse_priority debug paremters for more
    info. For trigger combinations, nonspecific parameters like fade_out are
    taken from the highest priority trigger.

resource_matcher <default: partial>
    Determines the matching strategy for the resource_name parameter. Accepts
    exact, partial, or regex.
    exact = The resource_name must match exactly.
    partial = The resource_name is allowed to partially match.
    regex = The resource_name is treated as a regex expression.

resource_name <default: [ any ]>
    The resource name or ID of the entity must match one of the entries here
    according to the strategy specified by the resource_matcher parameter.

start_as_disabled <default: false>
    If this is true the trigger will be toggled off by default and must be
    toggled on by something else to be usable. Unless you know how toggles
    work it is recommended to leave this at its default value.

ticks_before_active <default: 0>
    The number of ticks after the parameters are met before the trigger is
    active (or playable if not the highest priority).

ticks_before_audio <default: 0>
    The number of ticks after the trigger is active before audio can start
    playing.

ticks_between_audio <default: 0>
    The number of ticks after the audio finishes before the next entry in the
    pool can play.

toggle_inactive_playable <default: false>
    Determines whether the trigger should be toggled off when it is playable
    (all of its parameters and timers are met) but it is not the active
    (highest priority or in combination with the highest priority) trigger.
    Unless you have a good understanding of how toggles and trigger states
    work it is recommended to leave this at its default value.

toggle_save_status <default: false>
    Determines if and how the toggle status for the trigger is saved and set.
    Accepts integers from 0-2.
    0 = Nothing is saved or set. Toggle status will reset after a restart.
    1 = Toggle status will reset after the player logs out.
    2 = Toggle status will reset after the player logs out and be set when
        the player logs back in.

victory_id <default: not_set>
    Points toward the identifier of a registered victory trigger that should
    activate when the entities that activated this trigger are killed.

victory_percentage <default: 100>
    The percentage of entities that activated the trigger in relation to the
    min_entities which must be killed for the specified victory trigger to
    activate.
