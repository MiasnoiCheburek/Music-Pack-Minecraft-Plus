```
active_cooldown <default: 0>
    Determines the number of ticks that the trigger will not be able to
    activate for after being active and deactivating.

fade_in <default: 0>
    The number of ticks it will take the trigger to fade in after the trigger
    activates.

health_percentage <default: 30>
    Determines the percentage of current health in relation to max health
    the player must be at for the trigger to activate.

fade_out <default: 0>
    The number of ticks it will take the trigger to fade out when the trigger
    is no longer active.

max_tracks <default: 0>
    Determines the maximum number of audio tracks that will be able to play
    while the trigger is active. The counter is reset once the trigger is no
    longer active. Any value less than 1 will be treated as infinite.

not <default: false>
    Enabling this inverts the activation requirements meaning that the trigger
    will NOT be active when its parameters are met. Ignored by most time-based
    parameters.

passive_persistence <default: true>
    Determines whether the persistence parameter should be applied when the
    trigger is not active. When disabled, the trigger will ignore its
    persistence parameter if there is a higher priority trigger active.

persistence <default: 0>
    Determines the number of ticks after its parameters are no longer met that
    the trigger will be playable for.

play_when_paused <default: false>
    Determines whether the trigger is playable while the game is paused.
    Requires has_paused_music to be active for the channel.

priority <default: 4000>
    The priority value of the trigger in regards to other triggers that are
    playable at the same time. By default the highest priority trigger always
    wins and will be active, but that can be changed via the debug config. See
    the independent_audio_pools and reverse_priority debug paremters for more
    info. For trigger combinations, nonspecific parameters like fade_out are
    taken from the highest priority trigger.

start_as_disabled <default: false>
    If this is true the trigger will be toggled off by default and must be
    toggled on by something else to be usable. Unless you know how toggles
    work it is recommended to leave this at its default value.

ticks_before_active <default: 0>
    The number of ticks after the parameters are met before the trigger is
    active (or playable if not the highest priority).

ticks_before_audio <default: 0>
    The number of ticks after the trigger is active before audio can start
    playing.

ticks_between_audio <default: 0>
    The number of ticks after the audio finishes before the next entry in the
    pool can play.

toggle_inactive_playable <default: false>
    Determines whether the trigger should be toggled off when it is playable
    (all of its parameters and timers are met) but it is not the active
    (highest priority or in combination with the highest priority) trigger.
    Unless you have a good understanding of how toggles and trigger states
    work it is recommended to leave this at its default value.

toggle_save_status <default: false>
    Determines if and how the toggle status for the trigger is saved and set.
    Accepts integers from 0-2.
    0 = Nothing is saved or set. Toggle status will reset after a restart.
    1 = Toggle status will reset after the player logs out.
    2 = Toggle status will reset after the player logs out and be set when
        the player logs back in.
