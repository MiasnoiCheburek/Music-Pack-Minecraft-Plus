If you have an issue or are confused about something, don't hesitate to let me know! You can do so by
[submitting an issue](https://github.com/TheComputerizer/Music-Triggers/issues) if you notice something not working
correctly, or joining the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FZHXFYp8fc) as I am very active there. Even if I am not
online, there will almost certainly be someone willing to help you out in setting things up.
